# The concept!

I’ve always followed the typical university rhythm: attend lectures, take notes, revise for exams. It works, don't get me wrong, but recently I’ve realised that this approach often pushes me toward short-term, exam-focused learning rather than building the deeper intuition I actually want.

So I’ve decided to shift my mindset. I’m starting **A Concise Introduction to Econometrics: An Intuitive Guide** by Philip Hans Franses, and I’ll be posting short reflections as I work through each chapter. The goal isn’t just to pass exams — it’s to understand econometrics at a level that feels solid, intuitive, and useful beyond the classroom.

This is my way of slowing down, strengthening my foundations, and engaging with the subject more deliberately. Looking forward to seeing how much I grow through this.

## A short book introduction

**A Concise Introduction to Econometrics: An Intuitive Guide** by Philip Hans Franses is a compact, accessible introduction to the core ideas of econometrics. Instead of overwhelming the reader with heavy mathematics, it focuses on building intuition: why models work, how to think about data, and what makes an econometric approach appropriate in real applications. It’s short, practical, and designed to give the reader a solid conceptual foundation before diving into more advanced material.
